This is a project I have developed as a favor for a friend.
He was excited to see what he might be able to produce with the rational multiples of a set base frequency.
He was referring the idea as *pure music*, and so I have chosen the name of the project.

## The Idea

This is me reciting the ideas he has conveyed to me:
The sounds we refer to as *music* is a set of notes that resonate well together.

As I personally also am aware of from my physics education,
a vibration is accompanied by its harmonics, i.e. vibrations that have the frequencies at
integer multiples of the original vibration's frequency.
While a vibration resonates exactly well with a vibration of the exact same frequency,
two vibrations that are related to each other with a rational factor would also more or less
resonate well together.

At this point, he was giving me some examplar musical keys like C and E# (I am making them up)
that are known to be in musical accord (aka. chord), which we would then test to see if they
were related with each other by a rational factor. They always were really close to being so,
but not exactly. The theory was that their accordance would be even better, if they were
exactly so.

## The Application

It seemed to me that he was on a right track. I helped, or at least tried to, develop his
ideas a little further.
